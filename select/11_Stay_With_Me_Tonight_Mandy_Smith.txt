Love may come and love may go
But people stay the same
Running round and asking questions
Play silly games
How can we stand and watch each other
Tear our hearts apart
Why can't we begin again and
Make a brandnew start
Stay with me tonight
Till the morning light
I wanna love you
I was so happy when we were together
I only wish that love would last forever
When I call you you don't answer
Why are you this way
When I tell you that I love you
Nothing much to say
How can we stand and watch each other
Tear our hearts apart
Why can't we begin again and
Make a brandnew start
Stay with me tonight
Till the morning light
I wanna love you
I was so happy when we were together
I only wish that love would last forever
