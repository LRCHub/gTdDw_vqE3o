Don't go, don't go, don't go, I love you so
One more chance
Biggie give me one more chance
One more chance
Biggie give me one more chance

First things first I poppa freaks all the honies
Dummies, playboy bunnies those wanting money
Those the ones I like because they don't get Nathan
But penetration unless it smells like sanitation
Garbage I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb never black and ugly as ever

However I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in the Mitsubishi
Girls pee pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they tee pee
As I lay down laws like Alan Coppet

Stop it, if you think they gonna make a prophet
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns, get it
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it then split it
In two as I flow with the junior mafia
I don't know what the hell's stopping ya
I'm clocking you, Versace shades watching you

Once ya grin, I'm in game, begin
First I talk about how I dresses this
In diamond necklasses, stretch Lexuses

The sex is just immaculate from the back I get
Deeper and deeper, help ya reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late and sing the break
Biggie here I am
All I need is one more chance

I will love you by yourself
Because you don't need nobody else
She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is, Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low down dirty even like his brother Keenan

Scheming, don't leave your girl round me
True player for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringing bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel

Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me, meet me at twelve
Where you at? flipping jobs, paying car notes?
While I'm swimming in your women like the breast stroke

Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke tongue all down her throat
Nuttin' left to do but send her home to you
I'm through can ya sing the song for me, boo?

One more chance
(One more chance)
Biggie give me one more chance
(Give me one more chance)
One more chance
Biggie give me one more chance
One more chance

So, what's it gonna be? Him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crush linen
Cartier wrist wear with diamonds in 'em
The finest women I love with a passion
Your man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashing

High fashion, flyin' into all states
Sexing me while your man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only the client, I'm the player president

One more chance
Biggie give me one more chance
(One more chance)
One more chance
Biggie give me one more chance
All I need is one more chance
(One more chance)

I will love you by yourself
(Biggie give me one more chance)
Because you don't need nobody else
(One more chance)
Biggie here I am
