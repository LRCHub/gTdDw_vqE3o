Oh, when you're without love, every day is a little more
Humdrum
Dreaming, always dreaming, how to make amends, how to
Keep a friend

Stay with me, lay with me, love me for longer than just
Your goodbye
I need a friend at the end of a long lonely day
All my tomorrows, my yesterday's sorrows are blown to the
Wind
Stay with me, lay with me, love let your loving begin

If you're without love, (you will know) you will know
(Just what it is)
What it is to be unloved, (all by yourself)
Thinking, always thinking, how to make a friend, how to
Keep a friend

Stay with me, lay with me, love me for longer than just
Your goodbye
I need a friend at the end of a long lonely day
All my tomorrows, my yesterday's sorrows are blown to the
Wind
Stay with me, lay with me, love let your loving begin

(Guitar break)

Dreaming, always dreaming, how to make a amends, how to
Keep a friend
