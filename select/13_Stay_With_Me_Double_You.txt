Dancing with an angel
Dancing with an angel
Dancing with an angel

Baby I needed you close to me
For just another day
Is there a reason that I don't know
For you to run away - Destiny of love
Is there nothing that I can do
To make you change your way
Is it love when you want somebody near you
Can't you stay?

Dancing with an angel, standing by my side, talking with me
Dancing with an angel, standing by my side, talking with me
Dancing with an angel, standing by my side, talking with me
Dancing with an angel
And I hear that voice inside
Dancing with an angel

No, no
Dancing With An Angel!
Wow Oh

Baby I love you but I can't follow you
So walk away
Is there a way I can speak to you
I've got a lot to say - Destiny of love
I will never forget you now
It seems like yesterday
And it takes a long time for me
To live another way

No No
Dancing With An Angel
Wow Oh

Oh Nana Yeah Oh Nana Yeah Oh Nana Yeah
Oh Nana Yeah Oh Nana Yeah Oh Nana Yeah
