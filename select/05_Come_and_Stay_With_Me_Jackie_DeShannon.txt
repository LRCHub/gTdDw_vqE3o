I'll send away all my false pride
And I'll forsake all of my lives
Yes, I'll be as true as true can be
If you come and stay with me

Lovers of the past I'll leave behind
There'll never be another on my mind
I'll try and see that you have all you'll need
If you come and stay with me

Promises I made most faithfully
I'll keep them still should you decide to leave
I'll do all I can so you'll feel free
If you come and stay with me

We'll live a life no one has ever known
But I know you're thinking that I'm hardly grown
I'll do all I can so you'll feel free
If you come and stay with me

If you come and stay with me
If you come and stay with me
If you come and stay with me
If you come and stay with me

Oh, ho
Come on and stay with me
Baby, baby, stay with me
If you come and stay with me
Baby, come and stay with me
